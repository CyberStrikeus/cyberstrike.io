Browser automation tool - USE THIS FOR ALL WEB OPERATIONS.

CRITICAL: This tool MUST be used for ALL web-related tasks:
- Opening URLs → use `navigate` action
- Web searching → use `navigate url="https://google.com/search?q=..."`
- Fetching web content → use `navigate` then `execute script="document.body.innerText"`
- Web scraping → use `navigate` then `execute` with scraping script
- Any website interaction → use this tool

NEVER use these alternatives:
- `open` or `xdg-open` commands (no traffic capture)
- `webfetch` tool (no traffic capture)
- `websearch` tool (no traffic capture)

This tool provides full browser control via Playwright with traffic capture for security analysis.

## Capabilities:
- **launch**: Start Cyberstrike browser with traffic capture
- **navigate**: Go to a URL (use url parameter)
- **status**: Get current page state (URL, title, recent requests) - USE THIS TO CHECK WHAT USER DID
- **content**: Get page text content, links, and forms - USE THIS AFTER USER ACTIONS
- **click**: Click an element (use selector parameter)
- **fill**: Fill a form field (use selector and value parameters)
- **wait**: Wait for element or network idle (use selector parameter)
- **screenshot**: Capture full page or element screenshot
- **execute**: Run JavaScript in page context
- **network**: Get captured network traffic (requests/responses)
- **har**: Export network traffic as HAR file
- **console**: Get browser console logs
- **close**: Close browser and save HAR file

## Usage Notes:
- Always launch a browser before other operations
- Network capture starts automatically on launch
- Use `har` action to export traffic for security analysis
- Screenshots are saved to the project directory
- Console logs include errors, warnings, and info messages

## IMPORTANT: Monitoring User Actions
After opening a page, the user may interact with the browser (login, click buttons, etc.).
To see what the user did:
1. Use `browser status` to check current URL and recent network requests
2. Use `browser content` to get the current page content, links, and forms
3. Ask the user "What did you do?" or "Are you logged in now?" before proceeding
4. Periodically check status to stay aware of page changes

## Security Testing Use Cases:
- Capture all HTTP traffic for vulnerability analysis
- Execute JavaScript to test XSS vulnerabilities
- Monitor console for security errors
- Take screenshots as evidence
- Analyze request/response headers and bodies
