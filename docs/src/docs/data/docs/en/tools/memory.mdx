The Memory tool provides persistent storage for findings, context, and information that should be retained across sessions.

## Overview

The Memory tool enables:

- Storing security findings
- Tracking tested assets
- Maintaining target information
- Preserving context across sessions
- Building knowledge bases

## Basic Usage

### Store Information

```
> Remember that the target uses PostgreSQL 14.2 on port 5432
```

### Retrieve Information

```
> What do we know about the target's database?
```

### List All Memories

```
> Show all stored memories
```

## Storage Types

### Findings

```
> Remember: SQL injection found in /api/users?id= parameter
```

Stored with:
- Finding details
- Severity
- Evidence
- Timestamp

### Target Information

```
> Remember the target's technology stack: React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database
```

### Credentials

```
> Remember discovered credentials: admin:Welcome123 (hash: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99)
```

<Aside variant="caution">
  Credentials are stored locally. Ensure proper security of your workstation.
</Aside>

### Attack Surface

```
> Remember discovered endpoints:
- /api/users (GET, POST, DELETE)
- /api/admin (GET) - requires auth
- /api/config (GET) - returns sensitive data
```

## Memory Organization

### Categories

Organize memories by category:

```
> Remember [recon]: Subdomain api.target.com resolves to 104.21.50.123
> Remember [vulns]: XSS in search parameter on main site
> Remember [creds]: Service account found in config file
```

### Tags

Add tags for easy retrieval:

```
> Remember #critical: RCE vulnerability in upload function
```

### Priority

Mark important findings:

```
> Remember as high priority: Unauthenticated admin endpoint discovered
```

## Retrieval

### By Category

```
> Show all vulnerability findings
```

### By Keyword

```
> What do we know about authentication?
```

### By Tag

```
> Show all #critical memories
```

### Recent Memories

```
> Show memories from this session
```

## Security Testing Workflow

### Reconnaissance Phase

```
> Remember discovered subdomains:
- api.target.com (live)
- admin.target.com (login page)
- staging.target.com (test environment)
- dev.target.com (development)
```

### Enumeration Phase

```
> Remember open ports on 192.168.1.100:
- 22/tcp SSH OpenSSH 8.2p1
- 80/tcp HTTP Apache 2.4.41
- 443/tcp HTTPS Apache 2.4.41
- 3306/tcp MySQL 8.0.23
```

### Vulnerability Phase

```
> Remember confirmed vulnerabilities:
1. SQL Injection in /login (Critical)
2. XSS in /search (High)
3. IDOR in /api/users/{id} (High)
4. Information disclosure in /api/config (Medium)
```

### Exploitation Phase

```
> Remember exploitation results:
- SQLi exploited: extracted users table
- Admin access achieved via IDOR
- Shell obtained through upload bypass
```

## Cross-Session Persistence

### Session Continuity

```
> Continue from last session - what were we testing?
```

The agent recalls:
- Previous target
- Discovered information
- Pending tests
- Findings

### Project Memory

Memories are scoped to projects:

```
project-a/
  .cyberstrike/
    memory/
      findings.json
      targets.json
      context.json
```

## Memory Management

### Delete Memory

```
> Forget the old database credentials
```

### Clear All

```
> Clear all memories for this project
```

### Export Memories

```
> Export all findings to findings-export.json
```

### Import Memories

```
> Import memories from previous-assessment.json
```

## Structured Data

### JSON Storage

```
> Remember target configuration:
{
  "host": "192.168.1.100",
  "ports": [22, 80, 443],
  "services": ["ssh", "http", "https"],
  "os": "Ubuntu 20.04"
}
```

### Tables

```
> Remember port scan results as table:
| Port | Service | Version | Vulnerability |
|------|---------|---------|---------------|
| 22 | SSH | OpenSSH 8.2p1 | None |
| 80 | HTTP | Apache 2.4.41 | CVE-2021-41773 |
```

## Integration with Agents

### Web Application Agent

Automatically stores:
- Discovered endpoints
- Form parameters
- Authentication flows
- Vulnerability findings

### Bug Hunter Agent

Automatically stores:
- Subdomains
- Technologies
- Interesting parameters
- Potential vulnerabilities

### Internal Network Agent

Automatically stores:
- Live hosts
- Open ports
- Service versions
- Credential findings

## Reporting

### Generate Report from Memory

```
> Generate security report from all findings
```

Uses stored memories to create:
- Executive summary
- Technical findings
- Evidence compilation
- Remediation recommendations

### Timeline

```
> Show timeline of findings
```

Displays chronological view of discoveries.

## Best Practices

1. **Store immediately** - Record findings as you discover them
2. **Be specific** - Include details for reproducibility
3. **Categorize** - Use consistent categories
4. **Include evidence** - Reference screenshots and logs
5. **Regular review** - Check and clean up memories

<Aside variant="tip">
  Use memory to track which assets have been tested to avoid duplicate work.
