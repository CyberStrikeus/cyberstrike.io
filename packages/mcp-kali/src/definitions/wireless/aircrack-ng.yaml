examples:
  - "aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt capture.cap"
  - "aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF capture.cap"
  - "aircrack-ng -a 2 -w rockyou.txt handshake.cap"
  - "aircrack-ng -e TargetNetwork -w passwords.txt capture.cap"

notes: |
  Capture requirements:
  - WEP: Need enough IVs (40,000+)
  - WPA/WPA2: Need 4-way handshake

  Capture with airodump-ng:
  airodump-ng -c [channel] --bssid [MAC] -w [file] wlan0mon

  Wordlists:
  - /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
  - Custom wordlists for target

  Performance:
  - Use -p for multi-threading
  - GPU cracking with hashcat is faster

  After capture:
  1. Check handshake with aircrack-ng file.cap
  2. Run dictionary attack
  3. Consider hashcat for speed
